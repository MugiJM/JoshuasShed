		<legend><h1>More About Me</h1></legend>
			<p>I believe, that I am good at listening to others.
			Whenever my friends would feel like ranting they would come to me because they know I would listen attentively.
			I think that I've been getting better because now I can help provide some closure and advice if necessary.</p>
			<p>Also, I think I'm good at singing. When I was younger I was on the junior choir at my church but now 
			I think I can properly find the right notes to hit and what songs my voice can manage and what songs it can't.
			When I was younger I would struggle with what notes to hit and how should I go about them but now they're not that much of a problem.</p>
			<p>Lastly, another one of my strong points is being gentle with people. Over the years I would struggle with what to say and how should I go about saying it as to not esculate a situation
			but now, I know how to think about what I'm going to say before I say it and how it is I should say it and how to respond to others to not make things worse.</p>
