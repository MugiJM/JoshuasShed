		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Salut! My name is Joshua Barrett. I was born on May 31, 2003. I went to Calabar Highschool and now currently attend Computer Science student at UTECH.
		I'm not exactly sure what career path I want to pursue in the future, however I would want to do something with programming.
		I am a quiet and anti-social person, but, I do enjoy spending time with the friends I have. My ideal day out would just be a plain trip to a park
		and we would just chill in one spot. One bad thing about myself is, I am very bad at managing my time.</p>
